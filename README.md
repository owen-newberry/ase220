## Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to manage a party of adventurers, handle their equipment, and enable players to add or remove items from their characters. The application allows you to switch between different categories of items (armor, weapons, and misc), load more items as needed, and track the equipment each member of the party has.

## Features

- **Manage Party Data**: Load and view party data from JSONBlob.
- **Equipment Management**: Add or remove equipment from a characterâ€™s inventory.
- **Pagination**: View more items when managing equipment by clicking the "Load More" button.
